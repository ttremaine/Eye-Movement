# Eye-Movement Project

## Description
This exercise is focused on using mouse events to bind DOM elements to events. In particular we were tasked with using the mouse movement event to update the position of two eye elements on the page so that the eyes follow the mouse position on the screen.

## How to Run
You can open the game at the following link: 
To run the game on your machine, download the files via the green Code button in the GitHub repository and open on your local browser.

## Future Improvements
I would like to add more styles to the page so that the eyes appear as part of a face. I would also like to add a background color.
